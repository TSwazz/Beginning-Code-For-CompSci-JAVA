//Problem Parameters
//A number is called perfect if it equals the sum of its proper divisors (1 is considered a proper divisor). 
//For example, 6 is a perfect number because 6 = 3+2+1. As with amicable numbers, the ancient Greeks attributed mystical 
//powers to perfect numbers. Read more about amicable numbers here.
//Write a program to find all perfect numbers between 2 and 10,000. There are not many.
//Use for loops for this program.

//Answer 

public class PerfectNumbers
{
  public static void main(String args[])
  {
    System.out.print("The perfect numbers between 2 and 10,000 are:");
    int min = 1; 
    int max = 10000;
    int sum = 0;
    for (min = 1; min <= max; min++)
    {
       sum = 0; 
    
    for (int i = 1; i < min; i++){
      if ((min % i) == 0) 
        {
          sum = sum + i;  
        }
    }
    if (sum == min) {
      System.out.println(sum);
    }
    }
  }
