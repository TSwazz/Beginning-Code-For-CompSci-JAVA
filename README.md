# Beginning-Code-For-CompSci-JAVA
I took an intro to a Computer Science class and struggled the entire time. I'm hoping to create a repo that has all of the code i successfully completed throughout the semester. 
Please keep in mind that this is the first time I've ever coded so there are bound to be better ways that things can be done. I just wanted to put all this stuff out there in case there is 
someone who can benefit from this.
