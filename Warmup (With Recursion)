//Problem Parameters
//Write a program with a method that calls itself 
//N times where the method prints There is a version of recursion. each time it is called. 
//The main method appears below and you MUST use this main method without altering it. 
//Also NOTE YOU CANNOT USE a while, do...while, 
//or for loop, you must use recursion.

//Answer 

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Warmup

  }
  
   public static int versionOfRecursion(int N)
