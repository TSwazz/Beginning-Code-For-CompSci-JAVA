//Problem Parameters

//A five-digit integer is said to be friendly if the leftmost digit is divisible by 1, the leftmost two digits are divisible by 2, 
//the leftmost three digits are divisible by 3, the leftmost four digits are divisible by 4, and the leftmost five digits (the five-digit number itself) 
//is divisible by 5. For example, the number 42325 is friendly because 4 is divisible by 1, 42 is divisible by 2, 423 is divisible by 3, 4232 is divisible 
//by 4,and 42325 is divisible by 5. Write a program that prompts for a five-digit integer and determines whether or not the number is friendly.

//Answer 

import java.util.Scanner;
public class FriendlyNumbers
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
      System.out.println("***** Friendly Number Detector *****");
        System.out.println("Enter five digit number:");
          int friendly_number = input.nextInt();
   
    if (((friendly_number / 10000) %1 == 0) && ((friendly_number / 1000) %2 == 0)  && 
       ((friendly_number / 1000) %2 == 0)  && ((friendly_number / 1000) %2 == 0)  && 
       ((friendly_number / 100) %3 == 0)   &&  ((friendly_number / 10) %4 == 0)   &&   
       ((friendly_number / 1) %5 == 0))   
    {
      System.out.print("This is a friendly number!");
     }  
     else 
     {
      System.out.print("This is not a friendly number.");
    }
  }
}
