//Problem Parameters
//The rules of a certain carnival game stipulate that a player throws one standard 6-sided die, 
//one 20-sided die (with 1 to 20 spots), one 8-sided die (with 1 to 8 spots), one 4-sided die (1 to 4 spots), 
//and one 12-sided die (1 to 12 spots). The player wins if the total on the five dice is greater than 35 or less 
//than 20. Write a program that simulates the carnival game 100 times and reports the number of times a player wins. 
//Your program should include a method:
//int rollDie(int sides)
//that returns a random number between 1 and sides. For example if you were to do this:
//System.out.println(rollDie(10));
//the program would output a number between 1 and 10.

//Answer

  // dieRoll method

    {
      int sumOfGames = 0;
      
      sumOfGames = sumOfGames + dieRoll(4); //die with 4 sides
      sumOfGames = sumOfGames + dieRoll(6); //die with 6 sides
      sumOfGames = sumOfGames + dieRoll(8); //die with 8 sides
      sumOfGames = sumOfGames + dieRoll(12); //die with 12 sides
      sumOfGames = sumOfGames + dieRoll(20); //die with 20 sides
      
      // sum < 20 && sum > 35 is a win
      //totalWins++
      
      if (sumOfGames < 20 || (sumOfGames >35))
      {
        totalWins++;
