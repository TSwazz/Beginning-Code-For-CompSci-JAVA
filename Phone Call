//Problem Parameters
//Write a program that calculates the cost of a long distance phone call. The calling rates are as follows:
//Time	Cost/Minute
//Day	      15
//Evening     7
//Weekend     5
//Your program should accept the length of a call in minutes and the rate code (use integers 0,1, and 2). 
//It will calculate the cost of a call. Your program should note any invalid data. (A switch statement would work well here. Use one.)

//I did not use a switch in this :(

//Answer 
import java.util.Scanner;
public class PhoneCall
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
  Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("Enter the length of the call:");
    int time_call = input.nextInt();
   System.out.println("Enter the rate code:");
    int rate_code = input.nextInt();
    
    if (rate_code == 0)
    {
      System.out.println("The cost of the call is $" +time_call *.15);
    }
      
    else if (rate_code == 1)
    {
      System.out.println("The cost of the call is $" +time_call * .07);
    }
      
    else if (rate_code == 2)
    {
      System.out.println("The cost of the call is $" +time_call * .05);
    }
    
    else 
    {
      System.out.println("Illegal rate code.");
    }
    
    
  }
}
